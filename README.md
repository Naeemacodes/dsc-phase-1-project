Title: Microsoft Film Studio Analysis
Author: Naeema Suleiman Sheikh

### Project Overview

For this project, we will explore what types of movies are currently popular at the box office by analyzing the current trends and providing insights for Microsoft's new movie studio.

## Business Problem

Microsoft will need to understand the preferences and interests of the target audience. Additionally, it may need to find ways to stand out and differentiate itself in the film studio market. The establishment of partnerships to attract top-level talent is very much required.  The cost of implementing new technologies comes with a significant financial investment and keeping up with the pace of the evolving technology is crucial.

## The Data

The data represents a sample of movies from different top genres that include adventure, thriller, and comedy. The variables included in the data may consist of movie titles, genres, year of release and gross summaries. The target variable is the financial success of the films. This will help Microsoft's new movie studio decide what type of films to go for   
## Recommendations
1. Explore digital platforms and create a strong online presence to reach the target audience and promote your films
2. Consider collaborating with producers/actors who are well known for their talent and build firm relationships with local film schools.
3. Provide opportunities for script development and foster an environment that supports innovative storytelling.
## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

* A **GitHub repository**
* A **Jupyter Notebook**
* A **non-technical presentation**

## Conclusion
By analyzing the visual representations, it is evident that there is a strong demand for various genres. Creating a wide range of films that deeply connect with the audience can have a significant impact on the industry. This will capture the attention of those who find comfort in movies. 

## Summary

See the full analysis in the Jupyter Notebook or review the non-technical presentation.
