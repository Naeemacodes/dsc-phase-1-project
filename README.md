Now you will put your new skills to use with a large end-of-phase project! This project should take 20 to 30 hours to complete.

Title: Microsoft Film Studio Analysis
Author: Naeema Suleiman Sheikh

### Project Overview

For this project, we will explore what types of movies are currently popular at the box office by analyzing the current trends and providing insights for Microsoft's new movie studio.

## Business Problem

Microsoft will need to understand the preferences and interests of the target audience. Additionally, it may need to find ways to stand out and differentiate itself in the film studio market. The establishment of partnerships to attract top-level talent is very much required.  The cost of implementing new technologies comes with a significant financial investment and keeping up with the pace of the evolving technology is crucial.

## The Data

The data represents a sample of movies from different top genres that include adventure, thriller and comedy. The variables included in the data may consist of movie titles, genres, year of release and gross summaries. The target variable is the financial success of the films. This will help Microsoft's new movie studio decide what type of films to go for   

## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

* A **GitHub repository**
* A **Jupyter Notebook**
* A **non-technical presentation**

Review the "Project Submission & Review" page in the "Milestones Instructions" topic for instructions on creating and submitting your deliverables. Refer to the rubric associated with this assignment for specifications describing high-quality deliverables.

### Key Points

* **Your analysis should yield three concrete business recommendations.** The ultimate purpose of exploratory analysis is not just to learn about the data, but to help an organization perform better. Explicitly relate your findings to business needs by recommending actions that you think the business (Microsoft) should take.

* **Communicating about your work well is extremely important.** Your ability to provide value to an organization - or to land a job there - is directly reliant on your ability to communicate with them about what you have done and why it is valuable. Create a storyline your audience (the head of Microsoft's new movie studio) can follow by walking them through the steps of your process, highlighting the most important points and skipping over the rest.

* **Use plenty of visualizations.** Visualizations are invaluable for exploring your data and making your findings accessible to a non-technical audience. Spotlight visuals in your presentation, but only ones that relate directly to your recommendations. Simple visuals are usually best (e.g. bar charts and line graphs), and don't forget to format them well (e.g. labels, titles).

## Getting Started

Please start by reviewing this assignment, the rubric at the bottom of it, and the "Project Submission & Review" page. If you have any questions, please ask your instructor ASAP.

Next, we recommend you check out [the Phase 1 Project Templates and Examples repo](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-template) and use the MVP template for your project.

Alternatively, you can fork [the Phase 1 Project Repository](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-1-project), clone it locally, and work in the `student.ipynb` file. Make sure to also add and commit a PDF of your presentation to your repository with a file name of `presentation.pdf`.

## Project Submission and Review

Review the "Project Submission & Review" page in the "Milestones Instructions" topic to learn how to submit your project and how it will be reviewed. Your project must pass review for you to progress to the next Phase.
